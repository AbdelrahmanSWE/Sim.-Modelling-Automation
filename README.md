# Sim.and Modelling Automation
introducing a new side project made to implement some simulations and models into Java OOP.<br><br><br><br>

## What can this Project currently do
### -Monte Carlo simulation<br>
Monte Carlo simulation is a process where we simulate a number of days in a service based on a sample input data from the service (demand and it's frequency).
### -Inventory Analysis simulation<br>
We use inventory Analysis Simulation to simulate the cost of holding stock and to determine a rough estimate of when and how much to order Stock in order
to maximise profit.<br><br><br><br>
