# Sim.and Modelling Automation
introducing a new side project made to implement the knowledge of simulation and modelling course that i covered in college.<br><br><br><br>

## What can this app currently do
### -Monte Carlo simulation<br>
Monte Carlo simulation is a process where we simulate a number of days in a service based on a sample input data from the service (demand and it's frequency).
### -Inventory Analysis simulation<br>
We use inventory Analysis Simulation to simulate the cost of holding stock and to determine a rough estimate of when and how much to order Stock in order
to maximise profit.<br><br><br><br>
## What is to be added
-Queuing Model<br>
-Transportation Model<br>
-Assignment Model<br><br><br><br>
# Goal
my goal with this project is to cover what i have taken in Sim and modelling course and train myself more in Java OOP.
